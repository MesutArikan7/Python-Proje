# Python-Proje
I wanted to share with you one of the projects I worked on while learning Python coding, which is a currency converter application. Inspired by daily needs, I developed this application to convert the prices of meals, alcoholic drinks, and soft drinks in the bills from our own restaurant into Turkish Lira using the current exchange rates from the central bank.
